# ***Jumble Words Solver***
## *Solve your Jumble Words - Type, Scan or Speak!*

#### **Business Problem Background** :

16th June '21 : Solving a few English Aptitude Questions, I came across some questions that were like, "Hey these are four jumbled words, rearrange them and find the odd one out among them."
Yeah I managed to score the highest, my rank was first of course but I thought about this idea.

My first instincts were to check the app store. Since I possess Android Device, Play Store was my pal.
I went through all the apps which were listed in the play store, inspected the features offered and went through a few reviews: both negative and positive to gain insights on what I can possibly make:

### ***Here are my conclusions***

> 
* Build an app that takes a word as input.
* Unjumbles it and gives possible combinations.
* Input can be in the form: Text Input, Scanned Image or Voice Input.
* There can be a parameter: Number of words that the potential output should consist of.

#### **My Workflow**

We'll decide it, I have something in mind, will be documenting later.
